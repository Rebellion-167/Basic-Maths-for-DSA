This repository contains some basic maths problems for DSA.

## Files

### 1. `Count_Digits.cpp`
Counts the number of digits in a number that divide it evenly.

### 2. `Reverse_Integer.cpp`
Reverses the digits of a signed 32-bit integer.

### 3. `Palindrome.cpp`
Checks if a number is a palindrome. A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forward and backward.

### 4. `Armstrong.cpp`
Checks if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that equals the sum of its digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

### 5. `Divisors.cpp`
Prints all divisors of a given number.

### 6. `Prime.cpp`
Checks if a number is a prime number. Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 with exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself.

### 7. `GCD.cpp`
Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.The Greatest Common Divisor of any two integers is the largest number that divides both integers.
